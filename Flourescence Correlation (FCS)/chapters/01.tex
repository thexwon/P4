\section{Aim of the Experiment}
Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) enables single-molecule observation in living cells by detecting fluorescence fluctuations as molecules diffuse through a microscopic region. This technique avoids the averaging limitations of traditional fluorescence methods and uses autocorrelation analysis to extract dynamic information from the signal. FCS will be performed using a confocal microscope to characterize fluorescent particles, determining their concentration, diffusion rates, and size.
