title={Observation of uniaxial anisotropy along the [100] direction in crystalline Fe film},
journal={Scientific Reports},
year={2015},
month={Dec},
day={04},
volume={5},
number={1},
pages={17761},
abstract={We report an observation of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy along the [100] crystallographic direction in crystalline Fe film grown on Ge buffers deposited on a (001) GaAs substrate. As expected, planar Hall resistance (PHR) measurements reveal the presence of four in-plane magnetic easy axes, indicating the dominance of the cubic anisotropy in the film. However, systematic mapping of the PHR hysteresis loops observed during magnetization reversal at different field orientations shows that the easy axes along the and are not equivalent. Such breaking of the cubic symmetry can only be ascribed to the presence of uniaxial anisotropy along the direction of the Fe film. Analysis of the PHR data measured as a function of orientation of the applied magnetic field allowed us to quantify the magnitude of this uniaxial anisotropy field as Oe. Although this value is only 1.5{\%} of cubic anisotropy field, its presence significantly changes the process of magnetization reversal, revealing the important role of the uniaxial anisotropy in Fe films. Breaking of the cubic symmetry in the Fe film deposited on a Ge buffer is surprising and we discuss possible reason for this unexpected behavior.},

journal = {Applied Physics Express},
abstract = {We have investigated a uniaxial anisotropy along the [100] direction of GaMnAs film grown on (001) GaAs. The hysteresis observed in the angular dependence of the planar Hall resistance shifted toward the [010] and [010] directions. This phenomenon was analyzed by introducing an additional uniaxial anisotropy field Hu2 along the [100] direction. The magnitude of Hu2 is much smaller than those of the cubic Hc and uniaxial Hu1 anisotropy fields for this material. The temperature behavior of Hu2 appears to be very similar to that of Hu1, suggesting the possibility that Hu1 and Hu2 have a common origin.}

    abstract = {We have performed a systematic Hall measurement on the GaMnAs ferromagnetic films. The angular dependences of the Hall effects were obtained by changing the magnetic field angle in two different crystal planes [i.e., (001) and (110)]. The in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy fields were obtained by analyzing the angular dependence of planar Hall resistance and anomalous Hall resistance based on the magnetic free energy model. While the cubic anisotropy fields both for in-plane and out-of-plane showed strong temperature dependence, the uniaxial anisotropy fields were insensitive to the temperature.},
