\begin{enumerate}
    \item Recording the gamma spectrum of a $^{57}$Co source and isolating the \SI{14.4}{keV} transition in $^{57}$Fe using a discriminator.

    \item Measuring the Mössbauer spectra of elemental iron, Vacromium (stainless steel), and two iron compounds (namely FePO$_4$, FeSO$_4$), and determining the absorption-line positions and isomer shifts.

    \item Determining the lifetime of the \SI{14.4}{keV} excited state in Vacromium.

    \item Determining the internal magnetic field and magnetic moment $\mu_a$ of the excited state in Fe.

    \item Determining the electric field gradient associated with the crystal field in the iron compounds.
